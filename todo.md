Some planned updates:

- remove context about separators at the bottom of settings, show when modifying a setting that needs it
- chat command shortcut key should not modify the note (plus it's broken)
- blank phrase == no activation
- always enable the keyboard shortcuts; don't have settings for them
- better attribution method for user/ai messages (maybe use html tags?)
- styling of messages (pro feature)
- Enable Keyboard Shortcut Trigger for new note and archive note and change model
